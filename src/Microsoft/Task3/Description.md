## Find maximum weighted path

In undirected graph find maximum weight path between two vertexes (nodes).

For example:

Input:

       [A] 
      /   \
     /     \
    1       5
   /         \
  /           \
[B]           [C]
  \           /
   \         /
    3       7
     \     /
      \   /
       [D]

Output: 5 + 7 = 13
